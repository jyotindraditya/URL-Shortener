This is a simple java program of a URL Shortener.
The interface is done using java awt & swing libraries. It consists of two inputfields for both URL and Integer id and two buttons to encode and to decode.
It is a demo URL Shortener that converts the URL into a unique key, much like the real world services. But instead of having a massive database I used a hashmap to assign unique integer ids to different URLs.
This project shows the backend working of the mainstream URL shorteners.
